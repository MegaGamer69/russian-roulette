2. LAN/VPN server service (e.g.: Hamachi or Radmin VPN);

### How 2 Start Match?
Start your server on the LAN service (untested).
Its recommended that you and other players to use the same LAN server service.
If you receive a "Lost Connection" error, ensure that the server is started-up.
Its normal if you does not receive text when run the **GameClient**, i'll fix this.

### Commands
You can run commands, that includes:

Pick the revolver if no one picked it:

```
/PickRevolver
```

Fire with the revolver if you are with it:

```
/FireRevolver
```

To send a message on the chat that have no moderation (!):

```
/Send <type your textual message here>
```

### How 2 Build From Source?

```

```sh
java Game
```

```

### Notes
If you are a streamer (like Tyroz, Felipe Neto or any other)
or content creator (like some Arena Breakout YouTubers, i love this game), send me honest feedbacks!

(DeepSeek is becoming smarter for formal contexts, im experiencing this and its not bad at this but its a informal game at the current moment).
