# Russian Roulette (JRR)
A JDK 7.0 compatible multiplayer (i hope) game made by me!

# How 2 Start Match?
Start a RAdmin VPN, Hamachi or any LAN server service (both are not tested, send me feedback!).
Its recommended you and other players to use the same LAN server service, only ensure that!
If you receive a "Lost Connection" error, check if the server is started-up.
Its normal if you does not receive text when run the **GameClient**, i'll fix this.

# Commands
You can run commands, that includes:

Pick the revolver if no one picked it:

```
/PickRevolver
```

Fire with the revolver if you are with it:

```
/FireRevolver
```

To send a message on the chat that have no moderation (!):

```
/Send <type your textual message here>
```

# How 2 Build From Source?
Before of all, you need to have the [JDK 7.0 or above](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/downloads/), its not recommended to use versions behind this.

You can build from source by running simply:

```sh
javac ./*.java
```

And run by running:

Server:
```sh
java Game
```

Client:
```sh
java GameClient
```

# Notes
If you are a streamer (like Tyroz, Felipe Neto or any other)
or content creator (like some Arena Breakout YouTubers, i love this game), send me honest feedbacks!

(DeepSeek is becoming smarter for formal contexts, im experiencing this and its not bad at this but its a informal game at the current moment).
