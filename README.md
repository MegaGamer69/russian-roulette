# Russian Roulette (JRR)
A JDK 7.0 compatible multiplayer (i hope) game made by me!

# How 2 Start Match?
Start a RAdmin VPN or Hamachi server (both are not tested, send me feedback!).
If you receive a "Lost Connection" error, check if the server is started-up.

# How 2 Build From Source?
Before of all, you need to have the JDK 7.0 or above, its not recommended to use versions behind this.

You can build from source by running simply:

```sh
javac ./*.java
```

And run by running:

Server:
```sh
java Game
```

Client:
```sh
java GameClient
```

# Notes
If you are a streamer (like Tyroz, Felipe Neto or any other)
- or content creator (like some Arena Breakout YouTubers, i love this game), send me honest feedbacks!
